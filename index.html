            <h1>About me</h1> My name is David Byrne and I'm a second year in computer science and IT in NUI Galway. I'm very interested in
            technology and spend a lot of my free time trying out new and exciting things, this website being one of the
            results.
            <br>
            <br> I'm using this website as a portfolio of sorts so you can see my other projects and code I've written. I try
            to keep updating this as I learn more and more so it's always a work in progress.
            <br>
            <br> My latest completed project is called <a href="http://david-byrne.github.io/Hangons/">Hangons</a> and it's described
            in the <a href="#web">Web</a> section. I'm currently developing a web app using the MEAN stack in a group project
            but that's not at a stage to share quite yet. Also I'm planning to make a proper Android app once I've learned
            enough Java so that's another thing to watch out for.

            <h1>Web</h1> I have made a few websites both for assignments and to improve my skills when I've got free time. They're getting
            better each time and I learn more and get more experienced at it.
            <br>
            <br> I designed this to add a unique look to my portfolio as I'm very interested in space.
            <br>
            <br> Over the Christmas break in second year I developed <a href="http://david-byrne.github.io/Hangons/">Hangons</a>.
            It's a fully client side web-app to parse the Hangouts.json data file you get when you back up your Hangouts
            messaging data. It uses Angular.js (1) and a Bootstrap theme and can convert the Hangouts.json file into a much
            more friendly format. It can create a simplified version of the JSON file which takes up less than a fifth of
            the space compared to the version offered by Google Takeout.
            <br>
            <br> I made <a href="http://danu6.it.nuigalway.ie/DavidByrne/WT/">The Working Title</a> in a group project at the
            end of first year in our C programming module. Unfortunately it doesn't do much at the moment as its back-end
            was built using C and CGI which isn't supported by the server it's currently on.
            <br>
            <br> Over the Christmas holidays in first year I built <a href="http://danu6.it.nuigalway.ie/DavidByrne/crypto/">Crypto</a>            to improve my cryptography skills. It supports Reverse, Rot13 and Affine cyphers but was more built as a proof
            of concept rather than to serve a cryptography service.
            <br>
            <br> During the first semester of first year I created <a href="http://danu6.it.nuigalway.ie/DavidByrne/BBB/">
				Byrne's Brilliant Bazaar</a> for the continous assessment part of the module. We were given a set list of things to include
            each week and we were encouraged to personalise it and give it a light humoured theme.

            <h1>C</h1> I did C in first year and you can see many of the labs and some of my projects on my
            <a href="https://github.com/David-Byrne/C-programming">C GitHub repository</a>.
            <br>
            <br>We finished the year with a final group project. My team decided to use CGI to connect it to a webpage for a
            GUI (see The Working Title in the web section). We incorporated the javascript we learnt in other modules as
            a client-side language as we weren't limited to just C for the project. The back end was written entirely in
            C and it kept track of stock, decrypted the card details, dealt with all the transactions, saved the details
            entered in feedback forms into text files and allowed people with admin access to edit and delete stock records.
            <br> At that point it was the largest single project either of us had ever done and our first time to use CGI and
            C in a non-trivial manner. We found it extremely satisfying however and learned loads from the experience.

            <h1>Java</h1> I started studying Java this year. During the first semester we we focusing on learning the Object Orientated
            aspects of it but now we're learning more about data-structures and algorithms. My labs and assignments from
            the first semester are up on my Java Github repo.
            <br>
            <br> With the Java I've learned so far I made a very simple android app but I'll wait until I'm more experienced
            in Java before doing any serious android development.
