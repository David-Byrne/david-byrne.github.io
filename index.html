				<h1>Web</h1>
				I have made a few websites both for assignments and to improve my skills when I've got free time.
				They're getting better each time and I learn more and get more experienced at it.<br>
				<br>
				I designed this to add a unique look to my portfolio as I'm very interested in space.<br>
				<br>
				I made <a href="http://danu6.it.nuigalway.ie/DavidByrne/WT/">The Working Title</a> in a group project
				at the end of first year in our C programming module. Unfortuantely it doesn't do much at the moment as
				its back-end was built using C and CGI which isn't supported by the server it's currently on.<br>
				<br>
				Over the Christmas holidays in first year I built <a href="http://danu6.it.nuigalway.ie/DavidByrne/crypto/">Crypto</a>
				to improve my cryptography skills. It supports Reverse, Rot13 and Affine cyphers but was more built as a proof of concept
				rather than to serve a cryptography service.<br>
				<br>
				During the first semester of first year I created <a href="http://danu6.it.nuigalway.ie/DavidByrne/BBB/">
				Byrne's Brilliant Bazaar</a> for the continous assessment part of the module. We were given a set list of things to include 
				each week and we were encouraged to personalise it and give it a light humoured theme.

				<h1>C</h1>
				I did C in first year and you can see many of the labs and some of my projects on my 
				<a href="https://github.com/David-Byrne/C-programming">C GitHub repository</a>.<br>
				<br>We finished the year with a final
				group project. My team decided to use CGI to connect it to a webpage for a GUI (see The Working Title in the web section).
				We encorperated the javascript we learnt in other modules as a client-side language as we weren't limited to just C 
				for the project. The back end was written entirely in C and it kept track of stock, decrypted the card details, dealt with all
				the transactions, saved the details entered in feedback forms into text files and allowed people with admin access to edit 
				and delete stock records.<br>
				At that point it was the largest single project either of us had ever done and our first time to use CGI and C in a
				non-trivial manner. We found it exteremly satisfying however and learned loads from the experience.
